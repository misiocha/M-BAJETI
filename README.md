Automated Financial Management App
Project Proposal: Automated Financial Management App
Problem Statement: Many people in our area receive their income in small, irregular amounts,
making it difficult to budget and save. Traditional budgeting methods are not designed for this
type of income pattern.
Project Objectives:
* Track income and expenses at a granular level, ideally at the time of each transaction.
* Help users categorize spending automatically.
* Allow users to set budgets and savings goals.
* Provide insights into spending habits to help users make better financial decisions.
Proposed Solution: A mobile app that connects to users' mobile money accounts using APIs.
The app will automatically categorize transactions based on predefined rules. Users can set
budgets and savings goals within the app.
Technical Implementation: The app will leverage API technology to interact with mobile money
platforms like M-Pesa. Machine learning algorithms may be incorporated in the future to improve
the accuracy of transaction categorization.
Example: Let's say a user typically receives around ksh.53,000 per month(cumulatively). The
app would connect to their account and start tracking transactions. The user could set up
categories like "Rent," "Groceries," and "Savings." As money comes in, the app would
automatically allocate it to the designated categories.
Challenges and Mitigation:
* User adoption: Focus on simplicity and user-friendliness to encourage usage.
* Transaction categorization accuracy: Implement a hybrid approach using rules-based
categorization and machine learning for continuous improvement.
Conclusion: This app has the potential to significantly improve the financial well-being of people
in our area by providing them with the tools they need to manage their money effectively.
